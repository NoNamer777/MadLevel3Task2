## MAD - Level 3: Task 2

This Mobile Application is developed as part of the introduction to the Mobile Application Development at HvA.
The application is used as an introduction to using fragments for multi view applications.

This app should be used to manage all the websites that a student at the HvA would need
in order to find information about his courses, what his schedule is and all the other
things that are important for his study.

The app exists out of two fragments, one to view the websites, the other to add them.
